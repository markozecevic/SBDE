Description: A set of API scripts written with a goal of simplifying differential expression 
    analysis on Seven Bridges platforms. The DifferentialExpressionAnalysis container 
    is used to keep track of data, chosen alignment and quantification/DE testing 
    workflows and their corresponding tasks. SBDE also extends the functionality of 
    VennDiagram package to allow for comparison of up to five different workflow 
    choices.
