Detecting differentially expressed genes across sample groups can be a major goal in the statistical analysis of RNA-seq data. Typically, a workflow for this type of analysis would consists of:

- sequence read alignment 
- gene expression quantification 
- expression normalization 
- testing for differential gene expression (DGE) 

There is a variety of tools developed for DGE testing and some are already wrapped and made available on Seven Bridges platforms. There is no general concensus on which tools to use and multiple studies evaluating the performances of different workflows have been published. The choice of aligner will also slightly influence the results of differentially expressed gene detection and gene expression estimation. 

SBDE package is a collection of API scripts written with the goal of simplifying differential expression analysis on Seven Bridges platforms. The DifferentialExpressionAnalysis container is used to keep track of data, chosen alignment and quantification/DE testing workflows and their corresponding tasks. SBDE also extends the functionality of VennDiagram package to allow for comparison of up to five different workflow choices.








It abstracts over the differences in seting up different workflows.








## More Examples

You can write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
load("~/R/SBDE/testscr/DEA1.RData")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
DEA1@title
```
